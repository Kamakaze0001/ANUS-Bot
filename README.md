<h1>This is ANUS</h1>

Anus was originally made to keep order in my University server. 
A couple years on, he's gaining independence and has a part time job.

I'm trying to make his code as neat as possible so that, 
even though he's rough around the edges, I can show him
off to my friends and/or future employers.
